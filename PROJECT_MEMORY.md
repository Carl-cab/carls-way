# Manna — Project Memory

> Running project log and live-state summary. For full architecture, coding standards, and conventions, see `CLAUDE.md`. Update this file at the end of every session.

## 1. Current Product Purpose

Manna is a peer-to-peer payment app for cross-border money transfers between the US and Canada. Users register with a country (CA or US), get a $100 seed balance in their local currency, and can send/request money. Cross-border transfers use live Wise FX rates. Bank accounts link via Plaid.

---

## 2. Current Stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router, Turbopack), TypeScript 5, React 19, Tailwind CSS v4
- Auth: custom JWT in httpOnly cookie `manna-token` (`lib/auth.ts`), route guard via `proxy.ts`
- Database: Supabase PostgreSQL via `postgres.js` (`lib/db.ts`, `getSql()` singleton)
- FX: Wise API (`lib/fx.ts`, `buildFxQuote()`)
- Bank linking: Plaid (`lib/plaid.ts`)
- Deployed on Vercel: https://carloscab74.vercel.app
- Repo: https://github.com/Carl-cab/carls-way

---

## 3. Current Architecture

- `proxy.ts` gates all `(app)` routes and `/`, checking `manna-token` via `getAuthUser()`
- `lib/db.ts` exports `getSql()` (singleton) and `initializeSchema()` (CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS)
- Schema migrations are ad-hoc: add columns to `initializeSchema()` AND `app/api/migrate/route.ts` (`ALTER TABLE ... ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`), then hit `/api/migrate` once after deploy
- Dual-currency: `balance_cad` / `balance_usd` on `users`; legacy `balance` column must never be used in new code
- Cross-border payments call `buildFxQuote()` and record `fx_rate`, `fx_fee`, `sender_amount`, `receiver_amount`, `is_cross_border`, `payment_rail`, `estimated_settlement`
- Velocity limits (`checkVelocityLimit()` / `recordVelocity()`) gate `type='pay'` transactions, vary by `kyc_status`
- All API routes return `NextResponse.json({ error })` / `{ success: true, ... }`; all queries use `postgres.js` tagged templates

---

## 4. Database Tables

- `users` — auth fields, `balance_cad`/`balance_usd`, legacy `balance`, `kyc_status`, country, avatar
- `transactions` — payments/requests, FX details (`fx_rate`, `fx_fee`, sender/receiver currency & amount, `is_cross_border`, `payment_rail`, `estimated_settlement`)
- `bank_accounts` — Plaid-linked accounts (`plaid_access_token_enc` currently plaintext)
- `friends` — relationships with `status` column
- `velocity_checks` — rolling hourly/daily/weekly totals per user
- `audit_logs` — audit trail of sensitive actions

---

## 5. Completed Features

- Core auth (register/login/JWT cookie), route protection via `proxy.ts`
- Dual-currency balances (`balance_cad`/`balance_usd`) migration applied to production
- Cross-border FX quoting and transaction recording via Wise
- Plaid bank account linking and display on profile page
- Velocity limit checks and audit logging on payments
- June 2026 UX audit fixes: `bank_accounts` table added to schema (fixed hanging profile page); Request Money page now sends `receiverUsername`; fixed "NaNd ago"/"Invalid Date" timestamp bugs on Feed and History pages; layout header now reads `balance_cad`/`balance_usd`

---

## 6. Known Bugs

None currently tracked. ~~Request acceptance used legacy `balance` field~~, ~~Activity filter chips non-functional~~, and ~~frontend password validation mismatch~~ are all **fixed** (see Session History).

---

## 7. Security Risks

- **Plaid access tokens stored in plaintext** (HIGH) — `bank_accounts.plaid_access_token_enc` despite its name is unencrypted. Must be fixed before enabling real ACH money movement.
- Ad-hoc migration system relies on manually hitting `/api/migrate` after every deploy — risk of schema drift between environments if forgotten.

---

## 8. Deployment Notes

- Vercel auto-deploys `master` on push
- Required env vars (set in Vercel): `DATABASE_URL` (Supabase pooler), `JWT_SECRET`, `PLAID_CLIENT_ID`, `PLAID_SECRET`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_PLAID_ENV` (`production`), `WISE_API_KEY`, `WISE_ENV` (`production`)
- After any schema change: deploy, then call `GET /api/migrate` once to apply `ALTER TABLE` statements to production

---

## 9. Current Priorities

1. Implement "Add Money" / "Cash Out" on profile page via Plaid Transfer
2. Implement KYC verification flow, wire up "Start verification" button
3. Encrypt Plaid access tokens

## 10. Session History

- **Initial build**: SQLite-based MVP for CA/US P2P payments, later renamed Carl's Way → Venmac → Manna
- **Postgres migration**: moved from SQLite to Neon, then to Supabase via `postgres.js` for Vercel compatibility
- **Dual-currency + FX + Plaid build-out**: added `balance_cad`/`balance_usd`, Wise FX quoting, Plaid bank linking, velocity limits, audit logging (on `master`/`documentation/handoff-package`)
- **Auth cookie fix** (`claude/cool-cerf-ErxD3`): fixed `proxy.ts`/`lib/auth.ts` cookie name mismatch (`carls-way-token` vs `venmac-token` → unified to `manna-token`), resolving broken auth routing
- **June 2026 UX audit**: fixed hanging profile page, Request Money field name mismatch, timestamp formatting bugs on Feed/History
- **Docs session**: confirmed `CLAUDE.md` matches handoff spec (no change needed); rewrote `PROJECT_MEMORY.md` into a concise 10-section live-state summary per updated project memory format
- **Request acceptance fix**: rewrote the `accept` branch in `app/api/transactions/[id]/route.ts` to use `balance_cad`/`balance_usd`, run velocity checks, build an FX quote via `buildFxQuote()` for cross-border requests, and record `fx_rate`/`fx_fee`/`sender_amount`/`receiver_amount`/`payment_rail`/`estimated_settlement` plus audit logging — closing the highest-priority known bug
- **Activity filter chips fix**: `GET /api/transactions` now honors `?filter=sent|received|pending` (in addition to `all`) via a composed `postgres.js` query fragment, matching what `app/(app)/history/page.tsx` already sends
- **Password validation fix (current)**: `app/(auth)/register/page.tsx` password field now uses `minLength={8}` and updated placeholder text, matching `validatePassword()` in `lib/auth.ts` (8+ chars, 1 uppercase, 1 number)
